    "# Project: Number Theory and Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "Cryptography is concerned with transmitting messages in such a way that they cannot be understood by an interceptor. Ever since written communication began, humankind has been using cryptography.  Constructing methods to do this is a very difficult problem, most methods eventually succomb to clever analysis. Number theory is at the heart of modern cryptography because there we find theoretical techniques with computational aspects which are very difficult to calculate in reasonable time using technology. These provide means to transmit messages securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suggested reading/viewing\n",
    "Most books on elementary number theory will contain relevant material (check the index for references to cryptography). Here are some specific suggestions ranging from YouTube/popular articles to academic papers.\n",
    "- \"The Code Book\", Simon Singh \n",
    "- Computerphile videos on YouTube (Elliptic curves, Diffie Hellman key exchange)\n",
    "- \"Mathematics and Technology\", Rousseau and Saint-Aubin, chapter 7\n",

    "#### Structure of Project\n",
    "There are five tasks in the document below, tasks A1- A4 and then task B1. Your group should do all five of these tasks. Tasks A1 - A4 are worth approximately 50% of the credit for this submission and task B1 is worth the rest (approximately 50%).\n",
